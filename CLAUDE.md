# Facturation SaaS — Claude Instructions

## LANGUAGE RULE (MANDATORY)

**Always use French** for all user-facing text across the entire system — no exceptions:

- All Blade view labels, placeholders, button text, table headers, page titles, breadcrumbs, error messages, success messages, empty-state messages, tooltips, and modal content must be written in **French**.
- All validation messages (`messages()` in Form Requests) must be in **French**.
- All flash messages (`session('success')`, `session('error')`, etc.) passed from controllers must be in **French**.
- All email templates and notification text must be in **French**.
- Code (variable names, class names, route names, comments) stays in **English** — only user-visible strings must be French.
- When generating any Blade file, controller response, or Form Request, verify every user-facing string is in French before delivering the answer.

## UI/UX Design System Rule (MANDATORY)

**Before creating any CRUD controller, Blade view, or any page in `resources/views/`, you MUST:**

1. **Find the matching reference template** in `resources/views/` — there are hundreds of static Blade templates that define the exact approved UI/UX for this project.
2. **Use the same HTML structure, CSS classes, and component patterns** from that template. Do NOT invent new layouts, components, or class names.
3. **Only replace static/dummy content** with dynamic Blade variables (`{{ }}`, `@foreach`, `old()`, `route()`) — keep everything else identical.

The full template mapping is documented in [UI_UX_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE.md](UI_UX_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE.md).

## How to Find the Right Template

Match your feature to the domain below, then look up the file in `UI_UX_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE.md`:

| Domain | Example templates |
|--------|------------------|
| Dashboard | `admin-dashboard.blade.php`, `super-admin-dashboard.blade.php` |
| Invoices / Sales | `invoices.blade.php`, `add-invoice.blade.php`, `edit-invoice.blade.php` |
| Purchases | `purchases.blade.php`, `purchase-orders.blade.php` |
| Customers / CRM | `customers.blade.php`, `add-customer.blade.php`, `customer-details.blade.php` |
| Products / Inventory | `products.blade.php`, `inventory.blade.php` |
| Settings | `account-settings.blade.php`, `company-settings.blade.php` |
| Roles & Permissions | `roles-permissions.blade.php`, `permission.blade.php` |
| Auth pages | `login.blade.php`, `register.blade.php` |
| Reports | `sales-report.blade.php`, `customers-report.blade.php` |
| UI Components | `ui-cards.blade.php`, `ui-buttons.blade.php`, `form-elements.blade.php` |

---

## Implementation Steps (for any CRUD/Blade page)

1. Open the matching static template from `resources/views/`
2. Copy its full HTML structure as the starting point
3. Replace dummy rows with `@forelse` / `@foreach` loops
4. Replace hardcoded values with `{{ $model->field }}` or `{{ old('field') }}`
5. Replace static URLs with `route()` helpers
6. Add `@error` / `is-invalid` for form validation feedback
7. Use `$collection->links()` for pagination

---

## Strict Rules

- **DO NOT** change CSS class names — they drive both styling and JavaScript behavior
- **DO NOT** introduce new CSS frameworks or custom stylesheets
- **DO NOT** reorganize div/section structure
- **DO NOT** create new component types — extend existing ones
- **DO** use the existing icon libraries already loaded in the theme (Font Awesome, Tabler, Bootstrap Icons, etc.)
- **DO** keep empty-state UI (`@empty` block) matching the template pattern
- **DO** preserve responsive classes (`d-none`, `d-md-block`, etc.)

---

## Common Blade Patterns

**Table with empty state:**
```blade
@forelse($items as $item)
    <tr>
        <td>{{ $item->name }}</td>
    </tr>
@empty
    <tr><td colspan="100%">Aucun enregistrement trouvé.</td></tr>
@endforelse
```

**Form input with validation:**
```blade
<input type="text"
    class="form-control @error('name') is-invalid @enderror"
    name="name"
    value="{{ old('name', $model->name ?? '') }}">
@error('name')<div class="invalid-feedback">{{ $message }}</div>@enderror
```

**Pagination:**
```blade
{{ $items->links() }}
```

**Action dropdown:**
```blade
<div class="dropdown">
    <button class="btn btn-sm dropdown-toggle" data-bs-toggle="dropdown">Actions</button>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu">
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ route('item.edit', $item) }}">Modifier</a></li>
        <li>
            <form method="POST" action="{{ route('item.destroy', $item) }}">
                @csrf @method('DELETE')
                <button class="dropdown-item text-danger" type="submit">Supprimer</button>
            </form>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

## UI CONTRACT — BLADE CRUD PAGES (MANDATORY)

This section defines hard engineering rules. Every new Blade view generated for this project **must** comply with all points below, no exceptions.

### Step 0 — Pick Your Reference File First

Before writing a single line of Blade, open the correct reference file from the table below and keep it open as you write:

| Page type | Primary reference file(s) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Index / List** (table + filters + actions) | `resources/views/customers.blade.php`, `resources/views/invoices.blade.php`, `resources/views/products.blade.php`, `resources/views/transactions.blade.php`, `resources/views/users.blade.php` |
| **Create form** | `resources/views/add-customer.blade.php`, `resources/views/add-product.blade.php`, `resources/views/add-invoice.blade.php`, `resources/views/add-quotation.blade.php` |
| **Edit form** | `resources/views/edit-customer.blade.php`, `resources/views/edit-product.blade.php`, `resources/views/edit-invoice.blade.php`, `resources/views/edit-quotation.blade.php` |
| **Show / Detail** | `resources/views/customer-details.blade.php`, `resources/views/invoice-details.blade.php` |
| **Roles & Permissions** | `resources/views/roles-permissions.blade.php`, `resources/views/permission.blade.php` |
| **Settings** | `resources/views/company-settings.blade.php`, `resources/views/account-settings.blade.php`, `resources/views/email-settings.blade.php`, `resources/views/invoice-settings.blade.php`, `resources/views/authentication-settings.blade.php` |
| **Dashboard** | `resources/views/admin-dashboard.blade.php`, `resources/views/super-admin-dashboard.blade.php` |

### Mandatory Rules

**Layout & Skeleton**
- Copy the exact page wrapper, `@extends`, and `@section` placements from the reference — do not invent a new layout hierarchy.
- Keep the breadcrumb/page-header area in the same position and with the same markup as the reference.
- Keep the card layout structure (`card`, `card-header`, `card-body`, `card-footer`) identical to the reference. Do not flatten or reorganize it.

**Class Names & Styling**
- Keep every CSS class name exactly as it appears in the reference (`br-10`, `dark-transparent`, `badge`, `ti-*` icons, etc.).
- Do NOT create new CSS classes or inline styles unless the identical pattern already exists in the reference file.
- Do NOT introduce any new CSS framework or utility layer.
- Icon usage must match the reference — same icon set (`ti` Tabler icons or whichever the reference uses), same size/placement conventions.

**List / Index pages**
- Copy the search input + filter row structure verbatim from `customers.blade.php` or the closest list reference.
- Copy the datatable wrapper, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and column structure from the reference.
- Place the "Ajouter / Nouveau" action button in the same position as in the reference (typically top-right of the card header).
- Replicate the action dropdown (Modifier / Supprimer / Voir) with the same menu items, icons, and `dark-transparent` badge or button style as the reference.
- Keep the pagination area markup matching the reference.
- Include the `@empty` / no-records row using the same empty-state pattern as the reference.

**Create / Edit forms**
- Copy the "form card" structure: same grid columns (`col-md-6`, etc.), same `form-group` wrappers, same label style, same required markers.
- Validation feedback must use `@error` + `is-invalid` + `invalid-feedback` exactly as shown in the reference forms.
- Button row (Enregistrer / Annuler) must be placed and styled identically to the reference.
- Help blocks and field descriptions must use the same markup pattern as the reference.

**Show / Detail pages**
- Use `customer-details.blade.php` or `invoice-details.blade.php` as the skeleton.
- Replicate the same layout blocks (info card, detail rows, related sub-tables) without reordering sections.

**Partials & Includes**
- If the reference uses `@include` for sub-components, replicate the same inclusion style. Do not invent a new partial architecture.
- Do not extract new Blade components (`<x-*>`) unless the reference already uses that pattern.

### Output Requirements (when generating a new view)

Every time you generate a new Blade file you must:

1. **State the reference** — begin your answer with: _"Based on `<reference-file>.blade.php` layout."_
2. **Provide the full file content** — no truncation, no `<!-- ... rest stays the same -->` shortcuts.
3. **Verify the UI contract** — run through the checklist below before finalising your answer.

### Fail-Safe Checklist (run before every final answer)

- [ ] Did I pick a reference Blade file that matches the page type (list / create / edit / show / settings)?
- [ ] Did I keep the same `@extends` / `@section` structure as the reference?
- [ ] Did I keep the same page wrapper, card, and header markup?
- [ ] Did I keep the same filter / search / table / action-dropdown layout?
- [ ] Did I avoid inventing new CSS classes, wrappers, or layout patterns?
- [ ] Did I keep icon usage and badge styles consistent with the reference?
- [ ] Did I keep the form grid, labels, validation feedback, and button row consistent (create/edit)?
- [ ] Did I keep breadcrumbs and page headings consistent with the reference?
- [ ] Did I include `@empty` / no-record state for all list pages?
- [ ] Did I provide the complete file (no omissions)?
- [ ] Are ALL user-facing strings written in French?
